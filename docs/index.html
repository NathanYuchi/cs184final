            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              In this project we looked at cel shading: how it's done and how we can modify it, but we also
              looked at other graphical effects as well.  We chose this topic because all the members in our
              group liked games and cartoons that used the effect.  In this project we first implemented cel shading
              by modifying part 5 of project 3-2.  We performed cel shading by computing the diffuse lightning and
              then clamped the lightining to cut-offs,resulting in a select number of colors.
               We then used Unity to create an interactive cel-shaded image with sliders
              that changed thresholds in the shader, resulting in different images.  We also used three.js to
              implement edge detection and silhouetting, an important component to cel-shading.  Silhouetting was
              achieved using sobel filtering.

              <h1>Edge detection was implemented in three iterations: 1. Silhouetting, 2. Normals-clamping, and 3. Sobel 
              Filter Mapping. We additionally implemented some basic alternatives to shadowing and speculars in 
              cel-shading format, and graftals.</h1>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              To make the demo we decided to use Unity because we couldn't get custom models to be properly
              cel shaded.  The first major step was to learn how to use Unity.  After learning the basics of
              Unity, we write the shader and apply it to a model in the scene.  For the shader we calculate
              the dot product of the surface normal and the light direction.  We then check to see which
              threshold the dot product falls into and calculate the color with a itensity value that we assign
              to each bucket.
              <pre>
                float _Cut1 = .95;
		float _Cut2 = .75;
		float _Cut3 = .25;

                half4 LightingCel(SurfaceOutput s, half3 lightDir, half atten) {
			half NdotL = dot(s.Normal, lightDir);

		    float intensity1 = 1.0; // intensity of most intense section
		    float intensity2 = 0.75;
		    float intensity3 = 0.5;
		    float intensity4 = 0.05; // intensity of least intense section

		    float val;
 		    if (NdotL > _Cut1)
		        val = intensity1;
		    else if (NdotL > _Cut2)
		        val = intensity2;
		    else if (NdotL > _Cut3)
		        val = intensity3;
		    else
		        val = intensity4;

			half4 c;
			c.rgb = s.Albedo * _LightColor0.rgb * (val * atten * 2);
			c.a = s.Alpha;
			return c;
		}
              </pre>
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
            We add sliders to our scene in Unity that allow us to directly mutate values inside
            of shaders.  In this case, the sliders affect the values <code>_Cut1, _Cut2, _Cut3</code>.By changing
            these variables, we   We do
            this by adding a script component to each game object that we want to see changes on.  We then add
            the script to each slider so that when a slider's value is changed, the slider's value is passed into
            the script and the corresponding cut number is changed.
            </p>
            <pre>

              public class SetCut : MonoBehaviour
              {
              	public void changeValue1(float newCut1) {
              		this.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.SetFloat("_Cut1", newCut1);
              	}
                public void changeValue2(float newCut2) {
              		this.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.SetFloat("_Cut2", newCut2);
              	}
              	public void changeValue3(float newCut3) {
              		this.GetComponent<Renderer>().material.SetFloat("_Cut3", newCut3);
              	}
              }
            </pre>
            <h3>Edge Detection</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              A key component in getting that cartoon feel with cel-shading is outlining.  The edge outline we did in Unity
              was done with a camera effect that shipped with Unity.  To show how edge detection and outlining are done, we used
              Sobel Filtering using three.js.

              <h2>Edge detection was attempted in three iterations: 1. Silhouette shading, in which we simply overlay a slightly-enlarged mesh of the original object, mask it, and then apply a contrasting color. While this proves
              effective for an outline, it does not capture internal edges, cross-overs, etc. To overcome this, we combined
              two more methods: 2. Normal Clamping. Here, the view vector is crossed with the normals of the face in the 
              fragment shader; and, given a certain threshold, say t=0.95, the magnitude of the cross is calculated to see if
              the face is perpendicular to the view. In this sense, if the face is perpendicular, then it is safe to say it will
              be viewed as an "edge" in the camera space, and thus should be highlighted a different color. This works for high thresholds, but fails for 1) large planes perpendicular to the view vector, and also has unappealing behavior at lower thresholds to generate thicker lines. 
              <br>
              Sobel filtering was another alternative, especially for objects with textures. Sobel filtering itself detects gradients, or C1 discontinuities / large changes; as such, it can detect naively a certain degree of edge behavior on textures. The output must also be clamped to preserve cel shading behavior, and also needs to be inverted (sobel filters will output edges as white, and surfaces as black, and is not as useful for making black outlines). Saito and Takahashi also recommend detection of C1 discontinuties to better detect against large changes in C1 as opposed to discontinuities. 
              <br>
              As an addendum, many alternative edge detection / stylization mechanisms were not operable in the standard THREE.js method, as they require edge traversal and edge objects themselves; a half-edge mesh would be more appropriate, but necessary accomodations for vertex-fragment shaders would be necessary. Saito and Takahashi also have better protections against mis-detection, but require a buffer as it needs to calculate gradients of all neighboring vertices, which would potentially be expensive without any form of cachin, etc.

            <h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              In our proposal and in our milestone presentation we mentioned that we wanted to apply cel-shading
              to colloids such as smoke and clouds.  Ultimately this was too difficult given the time limitations
              that we had.  Other groups did smoke and cloud simulation as their final projects and didn't even have to
              consider shading them in a non-photorealistic manner.  We did create an alternative to actually cel-shading
              colloids.  We took inspiration from the smoke and cloud effects from Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker where
              multiple 2D toon cloud and smoke "puffs" are emitted.  The 2D puff images are also billboarded so that
              they always appear "full" without making them look two dimensional.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              We start with a particle emitter, a GameObject given to us through base Unity.  We then create a smoke
              puff texture.  In this case, we just created a smoke puff .png file with a transparent background using
              Photoshop.  We change the texture of the particles in the emitter to the newly created texture.  We set the
              "Size over Lifetime" property of each the puffs so that they grow over time.  This simulates smoke spreading out
              as it travels away from the source.  We also set "Color over Lifetime" so that the smoke starts darkest
              closest to the source and becomes lighter and eventually transparent.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
            	As greater exploration into Non-photorealistic rendering techniques, two extra concepts were explored: 1) Graftals, which are simply randomly-added mesh patterns onto a base object to produce patterns, and 2) Billboarded Shadows.
            	<br>
            	Graftals should be akin to feathers or other textures, which have view-dependent behavior, with larger sizes as their faces are perpendicular to the view vector, and shrinking, or diminished behavior when parallel. Thus, it should accentuate the edge texture to emphasize outlines, while not being too busy in the actual object itself.
            	<br>
            	Billboarded Shadows are a quick way of implementing cast shadows, especially when it is difficult to get shaded materials to receive shadows. They simply calculate expanding quads whose bounding rays originate from the light source and point towards the ends of the bounding box of the mesh, extending backwards into the distance. This can be an excellent approximation for small particles, even with rough edges and constant opacity.
            </p>

            <h3>Optional Further Study</h3>
            <p>An extension to the idea of view-dependent billboards is view-dependent meshes that interpolate between key meshes.
            This ties in closely with the animation idea of "staging", in which viewing the scene or object should accentuate the key features, and even if realistically rotating an object, for example, will produce strange silhouettes, it would be necessary to alter the mesh to better highlight all its features. The key challenges would actually be having keys for the mesh, almost like blend-shapes, and having a simple method of interpolation, that goes beyond the abilities of THREE.js.</p>
